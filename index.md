Reproducible research is increasingly being recognized as a minimum attainable 
standard that we should strive for, especially in the field of scientific 
computing. In this lesson, we will explore 10 principles that you can follow 
to elevate your research to the next level in terms of reproducibility. 
Equipped with these principles, you and others will spend less time 
re-running your analyses. We will apply these principles in real time to 
a toy R project that we will start from scratch. Topics will include R, 
RStudio, Git/GitHub, R Markdown/Notebooks, Conda/Bioconda, and open research.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Some familiarity with R will allow you to follow along the hands-on demos.
> However, this is not strictly necessary for the lesson, as the principles
> are applicable for other programming languagues, although the tools may 
> differ.
