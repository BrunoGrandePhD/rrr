## The Why?

[Why Open Research?](whyopenresearch.org)


## The Why?

* Increase your visibility
* Reduce publishing costs
* Take back control
* Get more funding
* Publish where you want
* Get that promotion


## The How?

* Share data, code and results
* Use reputable repositories that can mint DOIs
    * Figshare, Dryad, Zenodo
* Include any metadata expected by your research community
* Include a [CITATION file](https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/blob/master/CITATION)
* Include a [LICENSE file](https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/blob/master/LICENSE)


> ## Practice
> 
> * Where to share data depends on the data itself
>     * If it's small, it can be included in your repository
>     * Institutional repository (_e.g._ SFU RADAR)
>     * Reputable repositories (_e.g._ Figshare, Dryad, Zenodo)
>     * Domain-specific repository (_e.g._ NCBI SRA for sequencing data)
> * Sharing code is as easy as switching the GitHub repository to public
>     * You can create a tag in Git to mark the version that was used
> * Share results in open-access publications
>     * You can also post preprints
>     * Journals policies can be found on [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php)
